# Changelog

Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org). Install a version with `sudo ./update.sh vX.Y.Z`.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-02

- One-click panel updates from the latest stable GitHub release, without root, with progress,
  retry and rollback on failed startup. Running tmux sessions and ttyd stay running.
- Backend and Chromium/WebKit regression tests with GitHub Actions.
- Review fixes: protected root installer checkout and unprivileged user file writes; same-origin
  JSON mutations and WebSocket checks; bounded, synchronized login throttling and JSON errors.
- Literal tmux input through buffers, exact terminal targets and conversation-specific Claude/Codex
  resume IDs. Nested agent hooks no longer replace the primary conversation ID.
- Safe session fallback, recovery of closed-session drafts, and preservation of text and attachments
  across login expiry. Polling captures only the active session and pauses in hidden tabs.
- Upload cleanup, complete colored wrapped links, correct keyboard hints and stable pinch zoom.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-02

First public release.

- iTerm2-style web UI for tmux sessions: vertical tabs grouped by project, live terminals (ttyd),
  status and "finished" indicators, hotkeys.
- Session types: Claude Code, Codex CLI, plain terminal; "terminal here"; restart keeping the
  conversation or fresh; git worktree per session; GitHub repo picker (device login via `gh`).
- One-click install / update / login for Claude Code and Codex (official installers).
- Weekly subscription limits for Claude and Codex with pace (norm marker, surplus/overspend, forecast).
- Sessions persisted and restored after a reboot or tmux crash.
- Phone: home-screen app, session screen with ANSI colors, message box, quick keys, image attachments.
- Login form with signed cookie; rootless Docker and resource limits for the panel user.
- `install.sh` for a clean Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 (Tailscale, Docker, agents); `deploy.sh` without root;
  optional public HTTPS via Dokploy's Traefik or Caddy with automatic Let's Encrypt.
- Versioning: `panel/VERSION`, update notice in the panel, `update.sh`, `release.sh`.
